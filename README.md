# d3.js Bubble Map, layering census and geographical data
This project inspired by [Mike Bostock's map](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/) is created with [topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) and data obtained from the [US Census Bureau](http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml). This map depicts poverty numbers for those under 18 by county. Data is visually represented with bubbles accompanying legend. Actual counties and numbers are shown on mouseover where available.
